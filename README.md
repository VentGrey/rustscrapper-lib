# Rustscrapper

The Rust-based linux cleanup system.

## Prelude

This is a small project born in some boredom hours at work. It's originally was a small Rust
program that aims to provide checking & solution for common server errors for
both local servers and digital ocean ones.



Now the project has taken another aim, instead we'll try to provide a CLI alternative to cleanup and maintain a linux system (for now) on a similar way to [Bleachbit](https://www.bleachbit.org/).
