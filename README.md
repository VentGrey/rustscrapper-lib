# H.C.S.P.S

The Hazardous Conditions Server Protection System.

## Prelude

This is a small project born in some boredom hours at work. It's a small Rust
program that aims to provide checking & solution for common server errors for
both local servers and digital ocean ones.

## How is this better than a bash script?

It really isn't. Maybe rust's safety and performance could help a bit but
calling some unix programs made in anything other than C won't be faster than
bash in any way.

## Usage
